   Many years ago  my dad was diagnosed (诊断) with a terminal illness . He was unable to work at     36   job . He would be fine for quite a while , but would then fall suddenly   37     and have to be admitted to the hospital .
He wanted to do something to keep himself    38    , so he decided to volunteer at the local children    39    . My dad loved kids . He would talk to them and play with them .Sometimes , he would    40    one of his kids . In certain instances , he would give   41     to the sad parents of these children .
One of his kids was a girl who had been admitted with a    42    disease that paralyzed 
(使…瘫痪) her from the neck down . I don’t know the    43    of the disease , but I do know that it was very sad for a little girl . My dad decided to try to help her . He started    44    her in her room , bringing paints , brushes and paper . He stood the paper up    45    a backing , put the paintbrush in his mouth and began to paint . He didn’t use his hands at all . Only his    46    would move . He would visit her    47    he could and paint for her . All the while he would tell her , “see , you can do    48    you set your mind to .”
  49     , she began to paint using her mouth , and she and my dad became friends . Soon after , the little girl was discharged (允许出院). My dad also    50    the children hospital for a little while because he became ill. Sometime later after my dad had recovered and    51    to work , he was at the volunteer counter one day and    52    the front door open . In came the little girl who had been paralyzed , but this time she was    53    . She ran straight to my dad and hugged him really tight . She gave my dad a picture she had done using her   54     . At the bottom it read, “thank you for helping me walk .”
Sometimes love is more    55    than doctors , and my dad-who died just a few months after the little girl gave him the picture-loved every single child in that hospital .

My first performance in front of an audience was coming up soon. 
I tried as hard as I could to remain  36, but I had an empty feeling in my stomach. I stared down at my sweat covered, 37 hands.
I looked up again at the audience, realizing that these were 38 people. They were not just my mum and dad, who 39 say, "Good job!" even if I messed up the entire piece.
What if I had the wrong music? What if I played the wrong notes?
As it 40, I was never able to answer these questions because the spotlight was 41 for me. I grasped my hands tightly together, drying off the sweat.
Slowly I walked to the mulberry piano in the 42 of the room. It contained 88 demanding keys, which were waiting impatiently to be played．I swallowed the golfball-sized lump（隆起的） in my throat and sat down. 43, I opened the music．Next, I rested my still shaking hands on the ivory keys.
As my fingers played across the keys, I was becoming more 44 of my preparation for this moment. But the memory of my year of training came flooding back. I knew that I had practiced this piece 45 that I could play it backwards if 46 .
Although at one point I accidentally played two keys 47 the intended one, I continued to move my fingers automatically （自动的）. YCY
My eyes burned holes into the page in front of me.
There was no 48 that I was going to lose my concentration. To keep this promise to myself, I leaned 49 and focused carefully on the music．
50 1 came to the end of the page, a warning 51 inside my head: DON' T MAKE A MISTAKE WHEN YOU TURN THE PAGE!
Needless to say, I 52    myself with all my heart and mind．And, proud of my "page- turning" feat（技艺） I finished the 53 of the piece without making a single mistake.
After the final note died away, a celebration went into action 54 my head．1 had finished．I had mastered （征服）the 55.

On a cold November afternoon, my mother and I were walking home from a pizza store. We were dressed warmly and      36     with the rented video we had been dying for watch, I was feeling a little   37  , as I was carrying our shopping, bags of snacks and the    38   .
They were so heavy that I decided to   39   some things. So I started to walk towards the garbage can   40   I noticed a poor man walking his bike out of the restaurant in front of us. He _41  a paper bag with his dirty hand. He headed over to another nearby garbage can and started _42  it.

One summer night, on my way home from work, I decided to see a movie. I knew the theatre would be air-conditioned and I couldn’t face my  16  apartment.
Sitting in the theater I had to look through the  17  between the two tall heads in front of me. I had to keep changing the angle ( 角度)  18  she leaned over to talk to him,  19 he leaned over to kiss her. Why do Americans express such feelings in a  20  place?
I thought the movie would be good for my English, but  21  it turned out, it was an 22  movie. After about an hour I decided to give up the movie and  23  my popcorn (爆米花). I’ve never understood why they give you so much popcorn! It tasted pretty good,  24.
After a while I heard  25  more of the romantic-sounding Italians. I just heard the  26  of the popcorn crunching (嘎扎的响声) between my teeth. My thought started to  27 . I remembered when I was in South Korea, I  28  to watch Kojak on TV frequently. He spoke perfect Korean―I was really amazed. He seemed like a good friend to me  29  I saw him again in New York speaking  30  English instead of perfect Korean. He didn’t even have a Korean accent and I  31  like I had been cheated. When our family moved to the United States six years ago, none of us spoke any English.  32  we had begun to learn a few words, my mother suggested that we all should speak English at home. Everyone agreed, but our house became very  33  and we all seemed to avoid each other. We sat at the dinner table in silence,  34  that to speaking the difficult language. Mother tried to say something in English, but it  35  out all wrong and we all burnt into laughter and decided to forget it! We have been speaking Korean at home ever since.

	My wife and I had just finished the 150-mile trip home from our daughter’s college. It was
the  21  time in our lives that she would be gone for any length of  22  .We wondered how
other people had   23  it.
	Later in bed, I  24  the time I started college. My father had driven me, too. My mother had to stay behind to  25  the cows from getting into the crops. I, the fourth in a line of brothers, was the first to  26  college.
	The truck was slow and I was glad. I didn’t want to get to  27  too soon. I shook hands with my father in the truck and he didn’t say a word. But I knew he was going to make a little  28  . He finally said,“I never went to college and   29  of your brothers went to college. I can’t say you don’t do this or that, because everything is different and I don’t know what is going to  30  , but I think things will work out. When you get a job, be sure to be  31  and work hard.”I knew that soon I would be   32  in the big town and I would be missing the life of the family.
	Then my father brought out the Bible that he had  33  so often. I knew that he would miss it but I must take it. He just said，“This can help you  34  you will let it.”
	When I finished school I took the Bible back to my father. But he said he wanted me to  35  it.
	Now, too late, I remember. It would have been so  36  to give it to my daughter when she got out of the car. But I didn’t. I could give her  37  .My father could give me  38  a Bible. But I don’t really believe now that I gave her half as  39  as my father gave me. So the next morning I did up the book and sent it to her. I wrote a  40  .“This can help you,”I said,“if you will let it”

One day, a poor boy who was trying to pay his way through school by selling goods from door to door found that he only had one dime left. He was hungry so he decided to     36     for a meal at the next house.
However, he lost his nerve      37     a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked     38     so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it      39     , and then asked, “How much do I owe you?”
“You don’t owe me anything,” she     40    . “Mother has taught me never to accept pay for a 
__41   .” He said, “Then I thank you from the bottom of my heart.” As Howard Kelly left that house, he not only felt stronger     42    , but it also increased his faith in God and human race. He was about to give up and quit before this point.
Years later the young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where specialists can be called      43     to study her rare disease. Dr. Howard Kelly, now     44     , was called in for the consultation. When he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light     45     his eyes. Immediately, he     46     and went down through the hospital hall into her room.
     47    in his doctor’s gown he went in to see her. He      48    her at once. He went back to the consultation room and      49     to do his best to save her life. From that day on, he gave    50__attention to her case. 
After a long      51     the battle was won. Dr. Kelly     52     the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it and then wrote something on the side. The bill was sent to her room. She was afraid to open it because she was     53     that it would take the rest of her life to pay it off. Finally she looked, and the note on the side of the bill caught her     54   . She read these words…
“Paid in full with a glass of milk.”
(Signed) Dr. Howard Kelly
Tears of joy flooded her eyes as she     55     silently. “Thank you, God. Your love has spread through human hearts and hands.”

A feeling of excitement overcame me as I looked around the stadium.
At 5:30 pm, two hours before game time, I walked into the locker room（更衣室）. My    36   of school, music and what I planned to do on Saturday night were    37   with the simple aim to beat the football team across the field from us tonight.
Approaching my locker（衣物柜）, I noticed my teammates   38  . Some rested on benches, staring up at the ceiling    39   it were a film of the opposing team’s play. Some seemed a bit more    40  , using the time to tell jokes. A few stared at the field,    41    what will happen in 120 minutes.
Our coach, Tony Severino, came out of his office at 6 o’clock. He told the team how    42    this game was for the season, between two of the state’s top teams―my school and our opposing team, Liberty High School. His words gave the team impulse（冲动）it needed to   43  .
At 7:10 pm, warm C ups finished, we went over the game     44   and discussed what we needed to do for the next three hours. The sound of the national anthem（国歌）   45   that we were only minutes from the action. Our coach usually made a final   46  . But tonight was different. On this clear night he    47   looked around the room at all the players and shouted, “Let’s go and get them.” Even    48    the “get” came out of his mouth, we were already    49    our way out of the door.
Outside, a few young fans reached to touch our hands, eager to be a    50    of our school’s winning tradition. When I smiled and     51    my hand, the young faces lit up as if they had just met Superman.
Seconds later, the team ran onto the     52   , moving as a mass of blue, in front of a packed stadium. We enjoyed a noisy   53   from fans and the fight song played by our school band. Breathing in the    54    of one of the biggest game of the year, I felt we were sure to win. I told myself, “This was what it was all about” and    55    that it was for moments like this that I loved high school football. Y c

The worst thing is the headlines . I use the underground almost every day and watch the people travel , their heads     36    in their newspapers . The headlines today    37     suicide (自杀) bombers and of horrific attacks that they say    38     by members of our community .
Something on the journey is    39     . I am not   40      anything that would indicate I am a Muslim . I normally do not    41     it is Friday and I am on my way to prayers .    42    I sense an uneasiness in the carriage . People are   43      . No one is speaking and it must be said that no one is being    44     unfriendly towards me . But I think the    45     I get are different . I am being checked out , sized up . It is all a bit uncomfortable .
People are looking around for things and people    46     look suspicious (可疑的). I am doing it a bit    47     and in the coming days , as more claims are made about the people who did this and their aims , that feeling is likely to get     48    . As you look around the   49      , it is difficult to know what people are thinking . Some are    50     thinking “those Muslims come here and look what they do” but they    51     understand we condemn (谴责)this like everyone else .
Whoever did this didn’t    52     about who was killed or whether they were Christian or Muslim . They just had no respect    53     human life at all . We all travel around London and we use public transport . We have a much fear as anyone else about    54     in something . But in the coming days , everyone is going to have to work together and keep calm . We will look out for each other and that’s how we will    55     this difficulty .

Conservatism refers to the acceptance of anything familiar and refusal of anything strange or foreign . There are numerous facts that    36     the conservatism of the Englishmen .
The monarchy (君主制) as nominal (名义上的)   37     of the state still    38     in the highly developed capitalist country .
The national anthem was , is and will be in the    39     1000years the old “God Save the King (or Queen)”.
English judges as usual wear long wigs in law courts , as    40     in many films shot in Hong Kong . (As a colony of the British Empire , Hong Kong was once    41     to adopt the British legal system .)
   42     the fact that the feudal class is a    43     of only history significance , noble titles are given to distinguished persons , who would    44     the titles as something of the greatest honor .
Many Englishmen still spend lots of money    45     dummy (虚设的) fireplaces that are of no     46    at all, although their rooms are     47    by gas or electric fire . They find it difficult to say .   48     to the past .
As the first country to    49     the industrial revolution , Britain refused to    50     decimal (十进位) system until 1971. Pence , shilling , pound and inch , foot , yard…all these are hard to be     51    . 
English people are always suspicious of any new plans of the government . Today they are still
52     of the Europe integration plan , thus they are not willing to    53     pound to be integrated into Euro Dollars .
Never talk about any kind of    54     to an Englishman , he would surely be    55     and keep away from you !

Many adults see teens as energetic. Many of us see ourselves as proud. This thinking   36   many adults and us, too, to have the idea that if we can’t handle school or    37    life well, we’re just not trying.
But in my opinion that may not be    38   .
Earlier this school year, I was leaving my class one Friday, when suddenly it    39    like I had pulled a muscle in my back. I knew I was ill.
After a few days I stopped eating. This meant I lost    40  ; the clothes that I bought two weeks earlier began    41   loose. This time my parents got scared.   42  , I started sleeping less. My eyelids（眼皮）were constantly    43   .
I refused to   44   that I was ill. I kept my job working 25 hours a week in a shop; I didn’t   45   any classes. When I was hurting, I didn’t mind and kept on going.    46    it kills you, it makes you stronger, right?
But now I find myself thinking. Is it    47   it? I’m taking the classes and writing for the newspaper because it looks good    48    college applications（申请表）. And I’m working 25 hours a week so that, once I get into my dream school, I can    49    it.
Here I am, already sick from the    50   of work I’m doing in and out of school. So, what good is    51    application if I’m badly ill? What is the    52    of doing this work if I can’t enjoy the results?
In fact, by writing my    53    I’m telling all the people who    54    much about the future and worry about it now. This is my warning: Don’t climb the    55     dive if you don’t like the deep end.

Bird flu is becoming a new threat against human beings as well as birds.   36  , as the World Health Organisation (WHO) says, fears   37   worldwide that the bird flu virus could change into a more   38   form. At Shanghai's Pudong International Airport, all  39   leaving or entering must complete a(n)   40   declaration (申报) form that asks if travellers have had close   41  with birds or bird flu   42   over the past week.
They will also be screened with a special camera for high   43  , and must declare coughing or shortness of   44  . People with temperatures over 38 degrees will be further    45  .
At least 68   46   have died from bird flu since 2003. So far, most human cases of the disease are concerned in contact with   47   birds. But experts fear a human flu pandemic (传染病) will break out   48   the deadly bird flu virus changes into a   49   that spread easily between people.
China, which has more   50   than any other country, has called bird flu a "serious pandemic". It has reported 22 outbreaks among birds so far, and three confirmed human cases of bird flu. Two of them died and one was   51  .  
The preventive   52  , announced in a notice on the Government's website, are similar to those required during the 2003 outbreak of SARS, which ―   53   bird flu ― spread easily from person to person.
The WHO points out that the main route (途径) of human infection by the bird flu virus is 54  contact with sick birds, and that transmission from person to person requires very close contact with a sick   55  .

In Twain, many people know what a “motorpool” means. It is   21  known as a place for the maintenance of official business and government cars.  22  it is a place for vehicle maintenance.
	More than ten years ago I came to America on business and I took advantage of the 23 to visit my friend. My friend drove a car to  24  me at the airport, and took me to his home. Out of the 25 ,my friend drove his car into the innermost  26  , which had a sign“carpool only”. I   27  what“carpool”meant. I felt doubted whether he was going to a motorpool.   28  I thought myself clever in asking:
	“Is there anything wrong with the car?”
	“Nothing.  29  ?”said he.
	“Well then, why are you going to carpool?”I  30  .
	My friend couldn’t help  31  and told me that“carpool”refers to the lane that only the cars with two or more   32  can drive in. I felt rather embarrassed on  33  that.
	After dinner, my friend’s neighbour came over to ask whether he  34  “carpool”the next day.“  35  ，”my friend said“Iwil accompany my friend to go shopping tomorrow.”I was   36  again, wondering why he could not“carpool”with him since we had“carpooled”  37  .My friend explained to me again that the“carpool”that his neighbour  38  meant they in turn drove the car to work so as to save energy. The first“carpool”is a noun,   39  the second“carpool”is a verb. It is really  40  for newcomers in America to understand it in a short time.

Lose-Win is weak. It’s easy to get stepped on. It’s easy to be the nice guy. It’s easy to give in, all in the name of being a peacemaker.
	A girl named Jenny once told me about her   36     in the world of Lose Win during her eighth grade year before she finally broke       37  of it:
	My       38   with my mom all started one day     39     she said to me sarcastically（讽刺地），“Wow, you’re sure sassy（敢顶嘴的，时尚的）today.” I       40   it so literally（字面地）that then and there I decided to close myself off from her and never      41   back to her. So every time she would say something        42    I disagreed with her I would just say, “Okay,  43     you want, Mom.”
	But I really got cold quickly. And my    44    began to build. One night I talked to my mom about the school homework and she said, “Oh, that’s     45    ”and then went back to mop the floor.
	“Don’t you ever     46    ?” I thought. But I didn’t say anything and stormed off. She    47    had no idea I was upset. She would have been willing to talk to me had I    48     her how important it was to me.
At last, I just blew up. “Mom, this has got to    49    . You tell me everything you want me to do and I just do it because it’s   50   than fighting. Well, I’m sick of it.” This all came as a    51    to her.
After my blowup, we felt like we were     52   all over in our relationship. But it’s getting better all the time. We discuss things now and I always   53    my feeling with her.
If you adopt Lose Win as your basic    54    toward life, then people will wipe their dirty feet on you. You’ll also be    55   your true feelings deep inside. And that’s not healthy.

What is in the drug that makes you sick or dead ? For example ,cocaine is harmful ,but what makes it harmful?
   I can’t tell you all about drugs ,but I can   36  you think about them in this   37   way. Your body is a very complicated（复杂的） machine,  38  a lot of chemical machinery, all of which is finally turned   39   it all works together . Special chemicals, which we call drugs ,can affect it in many different ways.
   Some drugs are   40   when your body has a problem, as with disease-causing bacteria. Then someone may give you aspirin to keep your temperature from going too  41   or some penicillin（青霉素）  42  it stops the growth of some kinds of bacteria.  43   ,all drugs are really poison,  44  if you take too much ,so you must always use them   45   .
   Why do some people take drugs like cocaine ? For a little while they seem to make you feel better ,or happier .But  46    their effects have   47   ,your body has to pay an extra  48   to get back to normal. That makes  you want to get   49   of the drug .
Drugs like cocaine have their special effects because they act as   50   for your nervous system. They cut off some of your nerve pathways and take away some of your senses and your  51  .They make you want always more . And just a little too much can even   52  nerves to your heart and stop its beating .
Many of us worry about the   53  around us and what pollution does to us .How about your internal（内在的） environment, and what goes on   54   you ? You control that all by yourself in what you put into your   55  . Most drugs are pollutants .You would not want pollutants in the air and water around you . Why would you want pollutants in your body ?

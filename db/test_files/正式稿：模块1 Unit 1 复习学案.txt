II. Project (短文改错：找出文中10处错误，并更正)
   The radio club in our school was started two years before. One day, I just begin thinking about music for everyone, so I asked the headmaster that music could be played during break times. He approved the idea, but two years later I am in the charge of the radio club as the oldest student member.
   Our club is much more as just music. Every morning we tell students about the weather, recently news, and some special messages that the teachers want us to broadcast them. When parents come to visit the school and talk to the teachers, we often play song sung by students, and we also give special messages to inform the parents with events such as outings and school plays.
   I shall miss the radio club after graduation, but I know that it will continue without me.

第三部分：阅读理解（共20小题；每小题2分，满分40分）
　　阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C和D）中，选出最佳选项，并在答题卡上将该项涂黑。
A
　　The bicycling craze came in when we were just about at the right age to enjoy it. At first even “safety” bicycles were too dangerous and improper for ladies to ride, and they had to have tricycles. My mother had (I believe) the first female tricycle in Cambridge. And I had a little one, and we used to go out for family rides, all together; my father in front on a bicycle, and my brother Charles standing on the bar behind my mother. I found it very hard work, going noisily away on my hard tyres; a glorious, but not a pleasurable pastime.
　　Then, one day at lunch, my father said he had just seen a new kind of tyre, filled up with air, and he thought it might be a success. And soon after that everyone had bicycles, ladies and all; and bicycling became the smart thing in Society, and the lords and ladies had their pictures in the papers, riding along in the park, in straw boater hats.
　　My mother must have fallen off her bicycle pretty often, for I remember seeing, several times, the worst cuts on her legs. But she never complained, and always kept these mishaps(灾祸) to herself. However, the great Mrs. Phillips, our cook, always knew all about them; as indeed she knew practically everything that ever happened. She used to draw us into the servants' hall to tell us privately: “Her Ladyship had a bad fall yesterday; she cut both her knees. But don't let her know I told you.” So we never dared say anything. Similar accidents used to occur when, at the age of nearly seventy, she insisted on learning to drive a car. She never mastered the art of reversing(倒车), and was in every way a terrifying driver. Mrs. Phillips used then to tell us: “Her Ladyship ran into the back of a milk-cart yesterday; but it wasn't much hurt”; or “A policeman stopped her Ladyship because she was on the wrong side of the road; but he said she didn't know what the white line on the road meant, so he explained and let her go on.” Mrs. Phillips must have had an excellent intelligence service at her command, for the stories were always true enough.  
56. According to the passage, which of the following statements is true?
   A. The writer belongs to a high social class.             B. The writer comes from a poor family. 
   C. The writer didn't like to go bicycling with his parent.    D. The writer felt it a glory to own a bicycle
57. “Mrs. Phillips must have had an excellent intelligence service at her command” means ______.
   A. she was excellent in her service             B. she must have been extremely intelligent
   C. she must have been very good at getting information    D. lots of people worked with her
58. The writer admires Mrs. Phillips because ______.
   A. she had a much closer relationship with the writer’s mother
　　B. she was in command of all the servants in the writer’s family
   C. she had a more polite behavior than other servants
　　D. she seemed to know everything that went on
59. It can be inferred from the passage that the writer's mother _______.
   A. disliked slow driving              B. hated out-door life
   C. was good-natured old lady          D. was a strong-willed old lady  

B
　　March 1, 2006 -- The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently released a report with new recommendations for building strong bones in children, including three servings a day of dairy products, adequate Vitamin D intake, and even weight training for teenagers. The report stresses a new reason to ensure your child's bone strength: it can reduce the risks of bone fractures(破碎), breaks, and osteoporosis(骨质疏松症) in adulthood.
　　Bone mass is critical for children ages 8 and up, and of special importance during adolescence. To reach optimal bone mass, the AAP recommends that children:
?Maintain an adequate intake of calcium with three age-appropriate servings of dairy products per day (4 servings per day for adolescents). Low-fat dairy products, including skim milk and low-fat cheeses, are preferred over higher-fat products. Most older children and adolescents in the United States currently do not achieve the recommended intake of calcium, according to the AAP.
?Add Vitamin-D-rich foods to your child's diet, as it helps with calcium retention(保持力). Vitamin D can also be found in many dairy products, as well as in fish and stronger cereals(谷类食品).
?Begin weight training as teenagers. In addition to the recommended calcium and Vitamin D intake for all children, the AAP encourages introducing weight-bearing exercise during teen years in order to help build strong bones and set a precedent for a lifetime of weight training.
60. The passage is mainly about ______.
　　A. the value of weight training for teenagers      B. the importance of an adequate intake of calcium
　　C. how to prevent osteoporosis in adult.          D. how to build strong bones in children
61. Which of the following is true according to the AAP report?
　　A. To strengthen children’s bones, Americans prefer higher-fat foods.
　　B. Dairy products contain plenty of calcium and Vitamin D.
　　C. US children today have achieved adequate intake of calcium.
　　D. Adolescents are more likely to suffer bone breaks than adults.
62. According to the text, it is important for those aged ______ to strengthen their bones.
　　A. 0 to 8       B. 60			C. 8 to 15				D. over 20
63. Why is weight-bearing exercise recommended by the experts?
　　A. Because it can help reduce the risk of some bone diseases in later life.
　　B. Because it can help make children even stronger.
　　C. Because it can help take in more Calcium and vitamin D.
　　D. Because it is a lifetime exercise.

C
　　Londoners are great readers. They buy vast numbers of newspapers and magazines and even of books----especially paperbacks, which are still comparatively cheap in spite of ever-increasing rises in the costs of printing. They still continue to buy “proper” books, too, printed on good paper and bound between hard covers.
　　There are many streets in London containing shops which specialize in book-selling. Perhaps the best known of these is Charing Cross Road in the very heart of London. Here bookshops of all sorts and sizes are to be found, from the celebrated one which boasts of being “the biggest bookshop in the world” to the tiny dusty little places which seem to have been left over from Dickens’ time. Some of these shops stock, or will obtain, any kind of book, but many of them specialize in second-hand books, in art books, in foreign books, in books on philosophy, politics or any other of the numberless subjects about which books may be written. One shop in this area specializes solely in books about ballet!
　　Although it may be the most convenient place for Londoners to buy books, Charing Cross Road is not the cheapest. For the really cheap second-hand volume, the collectors must venture off the beaten track, to Farringdon Road, for example, in the East Central district of London. In places like this one can still, occasionally, pick up for a few pence an old volume that may be worth many pounds.
　　Both Charing Cross Road and Farringdon Road are well-known haunts of the book buyer. Yet all over London there are bookshops, in places not so well known, where books are equally varied and exciting. It is in the sympathetic atmosphere of such shops that the ardent book buyer feels most at home. In these shops, even the lifelong book-browser is frequently rewarded by the accidental discovery of previously unknown delights. 
64. In the bookshops of Charing Cross Road you can get ______.
   A. new books of great value             B. tiny dusty books 
   C. the cheapest books in the world        D. books on various subjects
65. According to the passage the best-known bookshops in London are ______.
   A. in the East Central district            B. throughout the city
   C. in some parts of the city             D. in the center of the city
66. Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?
   A. The book-browser never gets tired of exploring London's bookshops.   
　　B. Londoners have plenty of time to read books.
   C. Readers can seldom buy newly published books on Charing Cross Road.
   D. Books on Farringdon Road are in fact no cheaper than those on Charing Cross Road.
67. The underlined word “haunt” most probably refers to ______.
   A. a great man that is most respected by people           B. a place where people frequently go
   C. a rare picture worth much                   D. a most expensive vehicle with a long history

D
　　Being considered a leader in our society is the ultimate admiration. “Leadership has become the universal vitamin C pill,” says psychologist David Campbell of the Center for Creative Leadership in Colorado Springs, Colo. “No wonder, Leadership stands for power, commands respect and, most important, promises achievement.”
　　Contrary to popular belief, most good leaders are made, not born. They develop their skills in their everyday lives. Always give credit. Many leaders note that the most efficient way to get a good performance from others is to treat them like heroes. Giving public credit to someone who has earned it is the best leadership technique in the world. It is also an act of generosity that's never forgotten. Giving credit is more effective than even the most constructive criticism, which often hurts rather than helps. Kenneth Blanchard, coauthor of The One-Minute Manager, agrees. “Catch people doing something right!” he says. “Then tell everyone about it. The loyalty you will generate is the most important currency a leader has.” 
   “The best leaders know that taking a risk is not a thoughtless exercise,” says management consultant Marilyn Machlowitz. “Because the idea of risk also carries with it the possibility of failure, many of us tend to wait for others to take charge. But if you want to be a leader, you must learn to fail. Pick yourself up and start all over again.” 
68. When the writer says leadership has become the universal vitamin C pill, he means ______.
　　A. leadership can cure many diseases as vitamin C does
　　B. leadership is an essential part of everybody
　　C. leadership can prevent one from failure
　　D. leadership brings power, respect, achievement, etc.
69. What can be inferred from the passage?
　　A. Most people believe that good leaders are born.       B. Leadership skills are not easily obtained.
　　C. Leaders develop their leading skills in their everyday lives.
　　D. Giving credit is better than the most constructive criticism.
70. If you want to be a leader, you.
　　A. may die  thousand deaths                 B. should take more thoughtful exercises
　　C. get rid of the idea of risking so as to succeed   D. take the risk of failure
71. What's the main idea of this passage?
　　A. What is good leadership?                        B. How to be a leader.
　　C. Leadership has become the universal vitamin C pill.   D. Most effective leaders are made not born.


E
BERLIN----A German town has found that sleeping on the job, although in limited doses, can improve workers’ efficiency.
   For two years, civil servants in the small town of Vechta southwest of Hamburg, have been allowed 20 minutes after lunch to go home and take a nap, doze in the office chairs or otherwise relax, town spokesman Frank Kaethler said.
   “In the beginning employees were skeptical about the project,” he said on Monday. “But then they were happier and they started working better.”
   Kaethler said Vechta started the project because it had too much work for too few employees and no budget to hire new civil servants. A local health insurance company gave them courses on napping.
   Research by the Institute for Sleep Research and Medicine in Regensburg found that 22 percent of the overall German population naps. But institute head Jorgen Zulley said only Vechta appeared to have implemented a sleeping-on-the-job project.
   “Work and sleep are normally seen as opposites and many firms don’t want it to be said that their employees sleep in their company,” Zulley said.
72. The project that is mentioned in the text _____.
　　A. is promoted all through Germany         B. was first started in a small town in Germany
　　C. is popularized throughout Europe         D. has a good effect on controlling unemployment in Germany
73. What can be inferred from the last paragraph?
　　A. Work and sleep are both important to employees.
　　B. Sleeping in the company is bad for both the company and the employee.
C.	 Sleeping in the company might give others a bad impression about the company.
　　D. Sleeping in the companies is in fact against the company’s rules.
74. The underlined word “implement” can be replaced by ______
　　A. make use of		B. carry out     C. lose control over			D. succeed in
75. The best title for the passage is _____.
　　A. A Sleeping-on-the-job Project      B. A 20-minute Break at Work
　　C. Sleep after Lunch, Please!        D. Take Care of Employees’ Health

　　At one time or another, most farmers have problems with mice. This is especially true of grain farmers. Mice eat a lot of grain. They also carry diseases. People can get sick from eating or touching grain that mice have gotten into. 
　　There are some ways that farmers generally use to deal with these problems. One way is to use grain storage buildings specially designed to keep mice out. Another way is to use poisons to kill the mice. However, both of these methods can be costly. Farmers must buy the materials to build the grain storage buildings. Or they must buy the chemical poisons to kill the mice. But these poisons can also be dangerous to other living things -- including the farmers who use them. 
　　Today we tell about a way to kill mice without spending a lot of money. It is a simple but effective kind of mousetrap. 
　　The trap is easy to make. You need a twenty-liter container that is empty and uncovered. You can use a plastic or metal bucket. Dig a hole in the ground and place the container inside. The top should be level with the surface of the ground. Fill the container with water to within eight centimeters of the top. Add small pieces of grain wastes. These should float on the water. Also put some wastes on the ground near the trap. During the night, mice will come out to eat the grain wastes. They will fall into the trap and drown in the water. 
　　An agriculture expert in West Africa once wrote about a method used by some local farmers. This expert in Mali said his gardener set four traps with this method -- and caught one hundred fifty mice in just one night.

　　AIDS is a deadly disease, which is spreading fast throughout our country. As the chart shows, by the end of August, 2005, there had been 102,387 people infected with the HIV virus. The number of people who got AIDS came up to 30,158 and 7,643 people died of this disease. The AIDS virus can be transmitted through many routes. Taking drugs is the main cause of transmission. In our country in 2005,41.9% of AIDS sufferers were drug takers.
　　In order to prevent the fast spread of AIDS, we middle school students must fully drugs. Besides, we shouldn't look down upon those AIDS sufferers. What they need most is/are care and love.
     Let's remember: Stop AIDS, Keep the Promise.

Now I’d like to talk to you about the final exam. The exam will be held next Thursday, the last day of the exam week. Remember to bring along two or three pens in case you run out of ink Unlike the mid-term, this test will not include multiple-choice questions. There will be only articles. You will have to answer three of the five questions to write your articles. The exam will be quite difficult, which means you will be responsible for all of the subject matter we’ve covered in class. I would suggest you review your mid-terms as well as the textbooks and your class notes. The final will count for 55% of your grade in the course, the research project will count for 20%, and the mid-term 25%. I’ll be in my office almost all day on Tuesday of next week. If you run into any problems, please feel free to step in.
Good luck with your studying, and I’ll see you on Tuesday.

I flew to San Francisco to take care of some business with Mr. Jordan. But as soon as I arrived, I got sick and couldn’t meet with him. I had to put our interview off. Then, when I felt better I thought about visiting him at his home, but he lived too far away. I tried to telephone him during office hours, but he was busy. The secretary said that Mr. Jordan would call me back, but he didn’t. I gave up trying to do a new interview because it would take more time and effort than I wanted to spend. A few days later, I saw a man on the street who looked like Mr. Jordan, and I called out to him. It was someone else. When I returned to my hotel that day, I found a message, which said that Mr. Jordan had suddenly gone out of town on some unexpected business, I was sorry I had mused seeing him, but I really enjoyed my sightseeing in San Francisco.

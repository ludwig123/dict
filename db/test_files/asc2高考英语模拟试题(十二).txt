How old was I? I can’t recall. Maybe I was only 10, making it the first  36  after my father left, leaving me to  37  that sad place in my mother’s  38 . It was the Christmas when I  39  being a wide-eyed child and tried eagerly to play Father Christmas myself, to make it all  40  and bright again. It was the Christmas of the  41 .
Mom first saw the coat at Tobias, a nice  42   store in our town’s little mall. It was deep forest green. A  43 , heavy, wool dress coat. Mom pulled it out from the rack(架) and  44  it up. “Long enough,” she murmured and tried it  45 .
“I need a new coat,” Mom smiled before the mirror. She made any clothing look good, and this coat  46  her very well. She glanced at the  47 , then hung the coat back on the rack,  48  once more to feel the smooth brush of wool.
Eighty-seven dollars. But I didn’t think twice. As we  49  on through the mall, I found some excuse to return and asked one of the Tobias ladies to 50  the coat.
I raked (耙) every yard in our neighbourhood ―some yards twice ― and soon I got the coat. The store ladies wrapped it in their biggest   51  with bright blue paper and a thick silver ribbon. I don’t remember  52  I got it home, but I can still feel the  53  excitement and pride that filled me each time I glimpsed at the  54  wrapped gift hiding under my sweaters. I would occasionally imagine the big space the box would take up under our tree. Here it was ― joy, peace, and  55  ― all wrapped up, waiting for Mom’s surprise.

A
体裁：记叙文  题材：社会 关键字：actress, play, film, miniseries (电视连续短剧)

I was born in Korea, and my family came over to America when I was 10. I’m the middle child of three girls, and my parents moved so we’d experience a different life. They did it for our education and to give us more of a chance than they had. We moved to Staten Island, and I went to the High School of Performing Arts in New York City. My parents were bummed when I told them I wanted to be an actress. My father suggested I try pre-med (医学预科). But after they saw me in plays they were really proud. 
I graduated from Boston University and was doing theater in New York when I got cast in a Korean miniseries (电视连续短剧). We started shooting the show in New York, and then went to Korea to finish it up. They said I would be there for three weeks, but it ended up being two months. The miniseries took off, and overnight, I became recognizable. It was sort of like Lost. It blew up. Then amazing projects were offered to me. I kept thinking, “I’ll do one more and then go back to the U.S.” I ended up staying for seven years. 
Some people described me as the Julia Roberts of Korea, which is a bad comparison because she’s the queen of romantic comedy. I became famous in Korea for a dramatic role in a film called Shiri. I played a “La Femme Nikita” type of role. I was the girl with the gun ― all action.

www.bigisland.org
One of the best Hawaiian travel sites ― easy to use, and packed with a full-service menu: accommodations, activities (including descriptions of individual beaches and golf courses), tours, and a section on the island’s volcanic personality ― all with links for further information. Developed by the island’s visitors organization, it’s the best overall website on the Big Island. 
www.nps.gov/havo 
A must-read for anyone planning to do some volcano visiting. At first glance, this National Park Service website for Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is little more than a quick overview (总览), but click on the blue “In-Depth” button for the full story. It is packed with both useful travel tips and advice that could even save your life: Read the well-illustrated section, “Viewing Lava(熔岩): Common Sense is Not Enough. ” On a lighter note, the pages detail hiking trails throughout the park, with fine government maps and background on the wildlife. See the links page for three other, lesser-known NPS parks on the island. A superb site.
www.konaweb.com
Everything from a visitors’ guide to tips if you are planning a move to the islands, with numerous links. The overview of the island (and especially the beach scenery) is worth a stop. 
www.interpac.net/~mtbike
First stop for mountain bikers. Produced by the island’s mountain bike association, it includes descriptions and maps for 10 public off-road trails and contacts for local bike shops. 
www.hawaii.gov/dlnr/dsp/hawaii.html
Brief illustrated guide to the island’s state parks, from the Hawaiian Department of Land and Natural Resources.

体裁: 说明文  题材: 科普知识与现代技术  关键字: space, undersea, exploration
As in the field of space travel, new technologies continue to appear in undersea exploration. They share a number of similarities with each other ― as well as some important differences. 
Manned submersibles (潜水器), like spaceships, must maintain living conditions in an unnatural environment. While a spaceship must simply be sealed against the vacuum space, a submersible must be able to bear extreme pressure if it is not to break up in deep water. 
In exploring space, unmanned vehicles were employed before astronauts. In undersea exploration, on the other hand, men paved the way, and only recently have unmanned remote-operated vehicles (ROVs) been put to use. 
One reason for this is that communicating with vehicles in orbit is much easier than talking to those underwater. A vacuum is an ideal medium for radio communications, but underwater communications are limited to much slower sound waves. Thus, most undersea vehicles ― particularly ROVs ― operate at the end of long ropes. 
For a similar reason, knowing where you are undersea is much more difficult than in space. A spaceship’s position can be located by following its radio signal, or by using telescopes and radar. For an undersea vehicle, however, a special network of sonar devices must be laid out in advance on the ocean floor in the area of a dive to locate the vehicle’s position.
Though undersea exploration is more challenging than outer space in a number of respects, it has a distinct advantage: going to the ocean depths doesn’t require the power necessary to escape Earth’s gravity. Thus, it remains far less expensive. 
64. The purpose of the passage is ______.
A. to persuade you to explore the depths of the ocean
B. to tell some differences between two kinds of explorations   
C. to make you believe that the undersea exploration is better
D. to stress the importance of the undersea exploration
65. By saying “men paved the way” the author means that in undersea exploration ______.
A. unmanned vehicles were used in the beginning
B. men covered the ocean floor with stones and bricks
C. manned vehicles were employed before unmanned ones       
D. men invented unmanned remote-operated vehicles in the past
66. The sonar devices must be placed ______.
A. from time to time                
B. before the undersea vehicles dive 
C. when the undersea vehicles are diving
D. after the undersea vehicles dive
67. What can we infer from the passage?
A. Submersibles usually break up in deep water.
B. Undersea vehicles can receive signals immediately.
C. Radio communications are quite difficult in a vacuum.
D. Going to space needs power to escape the gravity.
     
D
体裁: 议论文  题材: 热点话题 关键字: grade, graduates, marks, degree
Are undergraduate grades important? Everyone knows that high marks earned at different schools or under different instructors can indicate very different levels of achievement. One professor may be a hard grader, while another is very generous or one who takes the whole business as a bit of joke. Some schools have high standards, whereas others don’t. And at all universities there is a constant tendency towards grade inflation(giving ever more high marks) that is fought fiercely at some universities but allowed to go unchecked for a long period at others.
Another point raised against grades is how poorly they predict how much graduates will be earning 15 or 20 years after getting their degrees. As many studies have shown, there is only a very poor correlation between undergraduate grades and future wealth. People who get good marks tend to go into professions, only some of which are highly paid. The correlation between undergraduate grades and success in business, the most common road to wealth, is in fact zero. Many ordinary students become successful businessmen, while some brilliant and capable graduates (creative youngsters, not students with special skills in passing exams) take up relatively low paying but interesting or satisfying careers. The general population, examining this question through a statistical point, sees one thing very clearly that good grades don’t translate in any direct way into big money, and for better or for worse, the standard of “success” for countless Americans is the acquisition (获得) of wealth.
The result is a certain modesty about good grades in America among those who get them. A student’s parents may brag (炫耀) about his marks, but seldom will the student himself risk being called a “grade-grubber” by drawing too much attention to his academic success. High marks are not something to be advertised to the world except on resumes (简历) and anybody who crows (夸耀) about them is likely to be viewed with contempt (轻蔑).
68. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?
A. Different grades show the same levels of achievement.
B. Professors are giving increasing high marks at present.
C. Professors give grades without checking students’ work.
D. Professors who are kind-hearted often give high grades.
69. Which of the following best describes the American attitude towards good grades?
A. The students with good grades feel very proud.
B. Good grades are something to be bragged about.
C. Not much importance is attached to good grades.
D. Students will risk everything to get good grades.
70. The underlined word “grade-grubber” (in Paragraph 3) probably means “______”.
A. a student who is fond of taking risks  
B. a student who is not good at academic study
C. a student who is interested in getting good grades
D. a student who isn’t satisfied with his grades at all
71. What might be the best title for the passage?
A. Are Grades So Important?
B. How to Get Good Grades
C. Positive Attitude Towards Grades
D. Modesty and Business Success

E
Some people call it a black cloud. I call it a real dump (垃圾堆) in the world. The beach was the only place I could go when I felt this way ― usually to relax ― but today, I wanted to do something I hadn’t since I was a teenager.
Walt and I used to hate the beach in the summer.
“There isn’t even a place to stick (放) our surfboards!” Walt cried, pointing toward the waves dashing against the beach.
“Tourists go home,” I cried.
“Too bad they can’t hear you.”
“Why don’t I write it down and send it to the newspaper?” I laughed, but Walt raised an eyebrow.
“I got a better idea!”
Board under arm, he marched to the shoreline and began dragging his big toe through the sand. In long, big letters, he wrote down the words “Tourists Go Home!”  which looked like a message to humanity.
From then on, we did that all the time, moving beyond our original slogan  to swears (咒骂) at tourists’ daughters and swears  at the lifeguards, and of course, according to my personal favorite and exactly what I planned to write today.
The sand were mashed (碎裂) under my feet as I marched toward the shoreline. But, as I came near a patch of seaweed, I noticed someone had written there already.
Just my luck!
I walked over slowly and stared. I must have read it ten times in disbelief ― words neither Walt nor I had ever considered writing.
There at ocean’s edge sat a general message ― not addressing anyone in particular, but to all who cared to look: “I Love You!” 
72. The writer and Walt decided to stop tourists coming to the beach because ______.
A. they were carrying out a research into environmental pollution
B. they wanted to protect the environment from getting polluted
C. they just wanted to have a place for enjoying themselves 
D. the waves were too rough for tourists to surf
73. Walt got a better idea that was ______.
A. to write some words in the sand
B. to write a letter to the newspaper 
C. to tell the tourists to go home
D. to tell the lifeguards to stop tourists
74. After the writer read the message “I love you!”, he must feel ______.
A. angry      	 	B. ashamed    
C. lucky    	 		D. happy
75. What would be the best title for the passage?
A. Crowded Beach            
B. Environmental Pollution
C. Touring at the Seaside     
D. A Message to Humanity

One possible version:
Dear Editor,
　   　As we all know, in our country, children must receive nine years of compulsory education from age six, but in our community I find something is wrong with the children of migrant workers. These children have entered the city along with their parents. Some of them are deprived of a proper compulsory education. According to my investigation, some 10 percent of the migrant children are out of school and about 75 percent of them can only attend cheap private schools where they are offered a poor quality of education with few facilities and few qualified teachers. I think the reasons are as follows: To start with, the parents are too busy to care about their children. Secondly, they haven’t enough money to pay their tuition fees for urban public schools.
　   　I hope local governments will be responsible for providing good education to migrant children. They should either let them attend public schools or set up special migrant schools.
                                                                  Yours truly,
                                                                  Li Hua
[部分解析]
单项填空:
21. C。 考查冠词。“人民币的兑换率”为特指,用定冠词the;“一种合理平衡的水平”为泛指,用不定冠词a。
22. D。考查非谓语动词。不定式短语所表示的动作发生在谓语动作之前,所以应用动词不定式的完成式。
23. B。考查动词词组辨析。aim at 目标是……; look at 看;think of 想出;想到;warn of 警告。此处aimed at... 作后置定语,修饰a five-year anti-AIDS education project。
24. C。考查时态。根据对话可知强调对现在造成的影响,所以用现在完成时。
25. A。考查定语从句。in which引导定语从句,表示“在这些事故中”。
26. A。考查连词。句意为:我还没来得及再说什么,他已冲向车站。until直到……才; when和as都表示“当……的时候”。
27. C。 考查时态。父亲从未想到过儿子在他找的那一夜一直在玩电脑游戏, 所以用过去完成进行时态。
28. D。考查交际用语。根据所提供的语境及关键信息if you insist可知汤姆同意起床。
29. A。 考查倒装句型。以“So + 形容词”开头的句子要进行倒装,根据结果状语从句和时间状语从句的谓语动词的时态可判断出要用一般过去时。
30. B。 考查动词辨析。recycle意为“回收; 再循环”,表示重复利用废弃了的东西。根据所提供的情景Irene does not throw away used envelopes.可判断出她重复利用这些信封。design设计,草拟;recover痊愈; 恢复。
31. B。 考查比较级。 as...as 表示比较时,中间必须是形容词或副词的原级,因而A项错误;than 必须与比较级连用,故C项和D项错误。此处使用的是“ times... + the amount/size/length of” 结构,表示“是……的多少倍”。
32. D。考查虚拟语气。 recommend后接宾语从句时,从句中的谓语动词要用“should + 动词原形”或动词原形。
33. B。考查时态。航班的取消导致许多乘客只能乘坐火车,强调航班的取消对现在造成的影响,应用现在完成时态。
34. C。考查情态动词的推测性用法。根据文意,那位工程师现在正准备申请专利,说明他很可能设计出了一种新的课桌,故用must have done。
35. A。考查强调句型。这个被强调的部分中又包含了一个定语从句。

完形填空:

39. D。 40. C。父亲不在的这一年,作者不再像小孩子那样睁大眼睛去看别人做事,而是尽力把自己装扮成圣诞老人,使圣诞节快乐 (merry) 起来。
41. A。根据下文,作者要将母亲心仪的一件外衣作为圣诞礼物送给母亲,所以说它是礼服圣诞节 (the Christmas of the coat) 。
42. B。适合母亲的衣服只有妇女商店(women’s store) 最佳了。
43. D。根据下文中的Long enough可知,那是一件长 (long) 外衣。
44. A。 45. B。由于是一件长外衣,母亲先举起来 (held it up) 看看它的长度、款式,然后试穿 (tried it on)。
46. C。母亲穿什么都好看,这件外套也不例外,非常适合 (suited) 她。
47. A。下文提到外套价格87美元,所以母亲看到价格 (price) 太高,就把衣服挂回原处。
48. B。母亲太喜欢这件衣服了,挂好后不是匆匆地离开,而是停下来 (pausing) 再次摸了一下光滑的羊毛。
49. A。没有买到衣服,我们穿过商场继续向前走 (moved on)。

阅读理解:
56. A。 细节理解题。由第一段中的“They did it for our education and to give us more of a chance than they had.”可知答案。 
57. C。细节理解题。由第一段中的“My parents were bummed when I told them I wanted to be an actress. My father suggested I try pre-med. But after they saw me in plays they were really proud. ”可知,父母亲当时并没有同意,而是建议作者先去读医学预科,只是当看到作者在戏剧中的表现时才感到很自豪。
58. D。段落大意题。第二段中着重介绍了作者的第一部成名作,之后片约不断,因此作者在韩国一呆就是七年,这应该是作者在表演上的首次重大突破。
59. C。推理判断题。由最后一段可知,作者认为把她称为韩国的Julia Roberts是不对的,因为在她看来,Julia是浪漫喜剧皇后,而自己则是以动作片而成名的,故应属于两种不同的风格。
60. A。文体主题猜测题。这篇文章列举了参观夏威夷岛屿的几个网站或链接,故选A。
61. B。推理判断题。由第三段 “The overview of the island (and especially the beach scenery) is worth a stop.”中的括号内容可知,这个网站里有风景介绍,故排除A;第二段中提到这个网站上有好看的插图部分,故排除C;第五段中也有插图介绍,故排除D。
62. C。细节理解题。由第二段可知答案。
63. C。推理判断题。由最后一段中“Also some interesting Big Island links.”可知,在coffeetimes这个网站中有Big Island的链接,可以进入Big Island网站。 
64. B。写作目的题。文章首段点出文章的中心。通读全文可知,文章从两种探索的环境、通讯速度、位置的确定及成本的高低等不同方面来比较探索太空和探索海底世界的不同。
65. C。 句意理解题。上文提到科学家探索太空时先用无人太空船试验,之后才用载人太空船;由关键短语on the other hand 及下文提到的无人潜水器最近才被使用可推知此处指探索海底不同于探索太空,是先用载人潜水器的。
66. B。 细节理解题。由倒数第二段最后一句可知利用声波探测水下物体的装置是在探索之前置于海底的。
67. D。推理判断题。文中第二段提到潜水器必须能承受极大的水压,并非指潜水器在深水处通常会被毁坏,故A项不正确;由第四段可知信号在水中传输速度慢,故B项不正确;由第四段中A vacuum is an ideal medium 可知C项不正确;最后一段指出探索海底有一个隐含的优点:不需要摆脱地球引力的能量,所以成本较探索太空稍低,由此可知,探索太空需要摆脱地球引力的能量。
68. B。 细节判断题。短文第一段最后一句话指出学校给学生的分数有越来越高的趋势,这种情况在一些大学里会得到比较激烈的抨击,而在另外一些大学里很长时间以来一直听之任之。据此可得出正确答案为B。
69. C。推理判断题。文中第三段提供了解题线索。第三段谈到美国学生对成绩一般保持谦虚态度,不会到处宣扬自己所取得的成绩,通过以上线索即可选出正确答案。
70. C。猜测词义题。由该句中的drawing too much attention to his success 可知这样的学生对取得高分非常感兴趣。
71. A。主旨大意题。文章主要论述了学生的成绩与将来事业的关系及美国学生如何看待成绩,故选A项。
72. C。 推理判断题。 A项和 D项均与文章无关;B项干扰最大,但从他们为了达到阻止游人来的目的,想出在沙滩写字赶人的主意,决不会有保护环境的高尚情操,只能是为自己的私利而已。
73. A。细节理解题。从“I got a better idea!”下一段的描述可知。B项只是开始时“我”的想法,没被采用;C项是不可能成为现实的想法;D项没提及。
74. B。推理判断题。作者对别人的诅咒与 “I love you!” 所表达出来的善意对比,足以令作者羞愧。
75. D。推理判断题。文章主要讲述了作者和他的朋友Walt在沙滩上写字想赶走其他游人,以便自己有足够的空间玩耍,在写字时却看到了别人写的非常乐观的、令人感动的字眼,这些字并不是写给某个人的,而是写给所有来这里游玩看到这些字的人,所以D项最佳。

　　The other day, I happened to meet someone I hadn’t seen for many years. I couldn’t believe the change in him. In fact, he didn’t even seem like the 36 person.
　　When I first knew Bill, back in 37, he was one of the most carefree（无忧无虑）people I had ever 38. He was always ready to have a party.

    Last week I was in Houston on business and I ran into Bill in the bar at the hotel. 45, I wasn’t even sure it was 46. Was this short-haired businessman really the same person? I wasn’t really sure until I came near him but it indeed was Bill. Now he works for a bank. He 47 most of the evening about his job, his new car and his house. How he had changed! Back when we were in college, the 48 thing Bill cared about was possessions. Now they seemed to be his main 49. Although I have changed quite a bit myself, somehow, I never 50 Bill changing so much. My image of him 51 the one I had formed 52 the time when we were college students together.
    I suppose it’s 53 to expect people to remain the same, especially 54 I have changed so much myself. But I must say that I enjoyed the old Bill much more than the new Bill. Maybe he 55 the same way about me.

第三部分：阅读理解（共20小题；每小题2分, 满分40分）
A
　　Ice draws the Dutch outdoors with a force old as their history. Ask anyone there why, and the answer is the same：“Because there’s so much water.” With one-
quarter of the nation below sea level and nearly half its land reclaimed from the sea, the Netherlands has many canals, lakes, rivers, and waterways. When winters are cold enough, these freeze into charming avenues for skating and celebrating Dutch culture with traditional events such as races with horse-drawn old-fashioned sleighs.
　　A deep freeze is rare, which adds to the attractiveness. “Our winters are influenced by the Gulf Stream and therefore are rather rainy and not very severe, ”says Co Rentmeester, who was born in Amsterdam. “But when winter is strong and very cold, the lakes and canals freeze, and the Dutch  become Olympians. It’s a national passion.”
  Last winter was strong enough to hold the famous Eleven Cities Tour, a 200-kilometer skating marathon through 11 towns that drew more than 16,000 skaters and half a million onlookers.Such events give the usually antinationalistic Dutch a chance to cheer their countrymen and their accomplishments. “We can walk on water and see the lands we made with a laughter. For Dutch skating champion Ria Visser, the attractiveness is more emotional： “To be in nature with the cold and the silence and the wonderful movement of skates, it’s like flying. You feel free.”
56. Ice draws the Dutch outdoors with a force as old as their history, which means____.
    A. ice has a long history which forces the Dutch to leave their homes
    B. ice is an old force in Dutch history that pushes people to engage in outdoor activities
    C. ice-sports have long since been the Dutch favorite outdoor activities
    D. ice-sports have long since been the force in Dutch history
 57. In the first paragraph, the Netherlands refers to________. 
     A. the land below sea level    B. the people of the nation
     C. the nation of the Dutch     D. the land reclaimed from the sea
 58. When winters are cold enough, the Dutch go skating on_________. 
     A. avenues       B. canals      C. airports     D. highways
 59. The Dutch winters are influenced by the Gulf Stream. which is
     A. a warm and powerful ocean stream 
　　　B. a cold and strong wind from the Gulf
     C. a cold and powerful ocean current     
　　　D. a warm and powerful wind from the ocean
 60. The Dutch can hold the Eleven Cities Tour when_______. 
    A. the Gulf Stream influences the winter weather
    B. winter is very severe
    C. they are the host for the Olympics
    D. half a million people take part

　　Computer That Understands Your Gestures
   Software that recognizes and converts the gestures of sign language into text on a screen could make working on computers easier and more natural for deaf people. Researchers have developed a system capable of recognizing International Sign Language(ISL), which uses gestures to spell out each letter of a word. Their success rate for recognising ISL signs is up to 96 percent. Since signing styles can vary, the system performs best when the person who’s using the neural(神经的)network also trains it. The researchers have not yet optimized the system for speed, so the program takes half a second to recognize the sign, running on a fast workstation. They believe they could improve accuracy with a feature that checks on easily mistaken signs. 
   The program works rapidly enough for it to be developed for realtime communications, the researchers say. ..     . “Now the software is able to understand ISL, we’re staring to look at the dynamic gestures that give whole words and sentences, ’’ says Djemel Ziou, who presented the research at a conference in Quebec on visual computing interfaces. Ziou says it will be possible to adapt the system for other alphabet systems. Once fluid motion can be rapidly analysed, the system may offer an alternative to the datagloves used in virtual-reality inter faces. 
61. The passage is mainly about_______.
    A. a new software for deaf people
    B. optimize the system for computer
    C. the foundation of a fast workstation
    D. the development of a software that recognising ISL
62. It can be inferred from the passage that the purpose of the software that recognising ISL is especial for_______.
    A. deaf people  B. all the disabled people  C. healthy people D. old people
63. Why the person who’s using the software will train it?
    A. Make the system performs best.   B. The signing styles Can vary. 
    C. Both A and B                  D. Make the system run fast. 
64. How to improve the accuracy of the system?
　　　A. Running on a fast workstation  
　　　B. With a function that checks on easily mistaken signs. 
　　　C. Optimizing the system for speed. 
　　　D. Trainning it for a long time. 
 65. Which of the following about the software is false?
    A. Now the software is able to understand ISL. 
    B. The system will be possible to adapt to other alphabet systems. 
    C. The system may be used in virtual-reality interfaces. 
    D. The system is able to understand whole words and sentences now.

A Letter from Tim’S Brother
  Dear Tim,    
    I have thought over very seriously the questions you raised about going to university. Weighing all the factors involving and appreciating your personal difficulties, I am nevertheless convinced that you should try to make it. 
   Given the choice of two young people to hire for the same salary, ninety—nine out of one hundred employers will pick a college graduate. In the long run, a university education is a solid financial investment that will pay a lifetime dividends in increased earning power, as well as in personal satisfaction.
If you fail to enter university this year, the probability is that you will never get around to going and for the rest of your life you will feel that every university graduate has a big advantage over you. 
   The financial difficulties are very real, Tim. I don’t want to underestimate them. But such difficulties have been overcome by a great many young people, some of whom have gone on to win national prominence. It isn't at all unusual for a boy to work his way through university full—time during the vocations and part-time during term. The biggest sacrifice is being made by Mother, who has a right to expect you to help with the household expenses at your age. Mother is, I am sure, more than willing to make that sacrifice.
   I am not going to tell you that working your way through university is easy. It means that you will have to work hard for at least four years, perhaps even five or six, if you want to be a post-graduate. You will have to miss some of the fun that other boys get out of university life. But I think that the fun you will miss in the next few years will be more than made up by the practical advantages you get from a university life. And what you do in these next few years will determine just what kind of person you will be and what kind of life you will he able to live. It is up to you to decide whether it is worth some years of hard work and sacrifice to make yourself a better—educated and more effective person. 
   An alternative is to go to a university where you can do on—line learning without quitting your job. In this way, you might be able to work full time and attend lectures on-line at any time in any places accessible to the Internet. This, of course, may mean that you’11 have to work even harder and longer hours. 
   I hope you will make the kind of decision that you won’t ever regret. 
    Affectionately yours
    John
66. From the letter, we can see that_______.
    A. Tim wants to go to university very much
    B. Tim has some financial difficulty to go to university
    C. Tim does not want to go to university
    D. Tim’s mother is eager for him to go to university
67. According to John, if Tim fails to enter university this year, he will probably
     _______. 
    A. manage to overcome his difficulties and go to university later around
    B. feel he will never get any advantages of a university student
　　　C. make some sacrifice for his mother     
　　　D. never get another chance to go to university
68. What is NOT the advantages of an university education that John mentions in this letter?   
    A. A college graduates will pay a lifetime dividends
    B. A university education will satisfy a person’s pursuit of self-fulfillment
    C. A university education will make one a better-educated and more effective person
    D. A university education will enable a graduate to earn more money
69. Working one’s way through university is not easy, because_______.
    A. one will miss some of the fun that other boys get out of university life.
    B. one will have to make up some practical advantages over other people
　　　C. one will have to work hard for at least four years      
　　　D. one must ask his mother to make the biggest sacrifice 
70. John suggests that Tim should————. 
    A. help Mother with household expenses while going to university
    B. overcome difficulties to win national prominence
    C. determine just what kind of person he will be and what kind of life he wants to live
    D. work full-time and do on-line learning in a university accessible to the Internet
D
    The arrival of computer, some people predicted, soon make paper a thing out of date. And guess what? Bill Gate’s dream of a computer on every desk has been more or less realized. Yet, most of people working at those desks fire knee-deep in paper. 
  Some research from a new book, the Myth of  Paperless Office suggests our increasing use of paper is due to the introduction of the very digital technology that was supposed to wipe it out. The studies show that it can lead to a 40％rise in paper consumption. 
   Xerox’s main business involved paper, and it was also alarmed by the prospect of its going out of fashion. So the research center invented the computing and printer technology that made sure it didn’t. Xerox knew what they were doing. 
    But our attachment to paper is truly amazing. Why store e—mail messages in paper files, which take up valuable space and are effectively unsearchable, when you call keep them on a hard disk and look through them for keywords? Why print off quantities of documents which are to be thrown away after the meeting is over, when they can be handed out electronically via intrantets (内部互联网)?
   If people love paper, there must be a reason for it. It is highly portable,flexible, 
and consumes no battery power. And it doesn’t have to be turned on before you can read it. 
   So the problem with the predictions is that they are always solution-driven. In fact, technology is not always the answer. The answer is not that people use so much paper, but that they don’t make good use of it. 
71. What changes has the computer brought in for paper?
    A. More and more paper is needed. 
    B. Its sale is reducing and it is to disappear. 
    C. Fewer people prefer paper to a hard disk. 
    D More paper of fine quality is produced. 
72. What does“the very digital technology” in paragraph 2 refer to?
    A. The new book.      B. The hard disk. 
    C. The computer.      D. The technology of printing. 
73. To protect their production from disappearing, Xerox——. 
    A. had the computing and printer technology invented
    B. took off the price of their production
    C. introduced new technology of paper making
    D. encourage people to store messages by writing them on paper
74. Which word can describe paper best according to the reasons for people’s love of paper?
    A. Fashionable.    B. Convenient.    C. Traditional.   D. Effective. 
75. What can we learn from the whole passage?
    A. Bill Gates’vision of the computer is to wipe paper out. 
    B. It is a stupid way to store e—mail messages on a hard disk. 
    C. Digital technology is the only solution to reduce the use of paper. 
    D. To print documents on papers has become a great waste now.

书面表达：
One possible version:
　　We must uphold these virtue including diligence, honesty, sympathy, courage, justice and responsibility. In my eyes diligence and responsibility are more important.
　　Traditionally, we admire the virtue of plain living and hard struggle. So the importance should be placed on diligence. Meanwhile, responsibility is also on the top. To shoulder some heavy responsibilities, we must keep a style of plain living and hard struggle. A person with a sense of responsibility can never be a lazy one. In addition, responsibility means honesty and justice.
　　Everyone must assume a set of responsibilities. For example, we students must take the responsibility for pursuing the academic performance. Therefore, it is wrong for many students to plant themselves in online games, an activity which seems escape them from responsibilities. Everyone must take on his own responsibilities and be devoted to his/her own position.
　　Unquestionably, diligence and responsibility are most important among the six virtues for us students. And we will never succeed without them.
